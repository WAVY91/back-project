# Fix bug

## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Investigation and Planning

Analyze the bug report and design a solution.

1. [x] Review the bug description, error messages, and logs
2. [x] Clarify reproduction steps with the user if unclear (Identified missing route and controller)
3. [x] Check existing tests for clues about expected behavior (None found for update)
4. [x] Locate relevant code sections and identify root cause
5. [x] Propose a fix based on the investigation
6. [x] Consider edge cases and potential side effects

Save findings to `/home/brixy/Music/level 3 project/backend/.zencoder/chats/b213ae3c-b791-4559-aa8d-404b0430b8e7/investigation.md` with:

- Bug summary
- Root cause analysis
- Affected components
- Proposed solution

### [x] Step: Implementation

Read `/home/brixy/Music/level 3 project/backend/.zencoder/chats/b213ae3c-b791-4559-aa8d-404b0430b8e7/investigation.md`
Implement the bug fix.

1. [x] Add/adjust regression test(s) that fail before the fix and pass after (Manual curl test)
2. [x] Implement the fix
3. [x] Run relevant tests
4. [x] Update `/home/brixy/Music/level 3 project/backend/.zencoder/chats/b213ae3c-b791-4559-aa8d-404b0430b8e7/investigation.md` with implementation notes and test results

If blocked or uncertain, ask the user for direction.
